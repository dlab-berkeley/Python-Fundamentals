    "* Methods are functions that only work on certain data types.\n",
    "* Lists are a collection of ordered items, which can contain different data types.\n",
    "* List indices start at 0, not 1.\n",
    "* The `.append()` method adds an item to a list.\n",
    "* Lists can be indexed using square brackets - e.g. `some_list[0]` indexes the first item of `some_list`. \n",
    "* Dictionaries are mappings of key-value pairs. \n",
    "* Dictionary values can be accessed using square brackets – e.g. `some_dict['name']` accesses the value corresponding to the 'name' key.\n",
